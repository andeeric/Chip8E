Curiosity on how emulators work led me to the Chip8 system and this short tutorial which got me started on my own small project http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/.

SDL is required to compile and run the application. https://www.libsdl.org/

Usage: Chip8E \<chip8 game file\>
